This is one of many exercise problems suggested by Facebook to study for technical interviews.
The site contains about 100 probkems covering different subjects.

To learn more about my approach for solving this problem, please refer to the following
post on my web site:

Due to some questions I have updated the code to better describe what I understood ad requirements.
I also added a function to help i;llustrate what I believe the question and the requirements are.

Of course, I might be mistaken and the requirements might represent something else.
If that is the case; please let me know what the actual requirements for this problem are.

Hope you enjoy solving the problem.

Regards;

John
